## The goal of this tutorial is to pair arbitrary bluetooth speaker with the Home Assistant (HASSO) to be able to hear notifications & Text-To-Speach (TTS)

### What was used during the installation:
Proxmox server
- BT dongle (Broadcom - BCM20702A0); A list of supported BT dongles -> https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth#known-working-high-performance-adapters
- Home Assistant (Supervisioned version) (for this tutorial Home Assistant 2023.6.3 -> Supervisor 2023.06.4 -> Operating System 10.3 were used)
- any bluetooth speaker without auto-inactivity or/and auto-shutdown function. I've used **Xiaomi Mi Compact Bluetooth Speaker 2 (XMYX02YM)** 
- ![Xiaomi Mi Compact Bluetooth Speaker 2](https://mi-home.pl/cdn/shop/products/2591_micompactbluetoothspeaker2-640px-hero_5b1911e4-9fdb-489b-b76e-d159d0e9ba1f.png)


### I. Connection:
1. Identify your BT speaker's **BT MAC Address** & **BT Name** 
2. Make sure that Proxmoxâ€™s HomeAssistant VM has an Audio device added (for example: ```device=intel-hda, driver=none```)
3. Install **SSH** add-on into the HA and configure it
4. Logging into the HA using terminal: login@IP_Address
5. Switch off your BT speaker
6. Type: ```bluetoothctl```
7. Type: ```list``` to list all of your connected BT dongles. You should get the MAC addresses of all your BT dongles
8. Type: ```select MAC_ADRESS_DONGLE``` to select your main one dongle (for example: select 55:44:33:22:11:00)
10. Type: ```default-agent``` to make selected BT-dongle a default connector with your BT devices
11. Let's start connection & paring with your BT-speaker.
12. Type: ```scan on```
13. Turn on your BT speaker & set it to paring mode
14. Check the console to see if your BT speaker has been detected (look for its name or MAC address). NOTE: Be patient during this process. If the speaker does not appear, try putting it back into pairing mode and checking again.
15. Type: ```pair MAC_ADRESS``` (for example: pair 00:11:22:33:44:55)
16. Type: ```trust MAC_ADRESS``` (for example: trust 00:11:22:33:44:55)
17. Type: ```connect MAC_ADRESS``` (for example: connect 00:11:22:33:44:55)
18. (in the case of any problems type ```help``` for more info)
19. Check the connected devices using commands: ```pactl list | grep ".a2dp_sink"```. Look for something similar to Name: ```bluez_sink.4C_72_74_XX_XX_XX.a2dp_sink``` (NOTE: the number represents the MAC address of your BT speaker)

21. Set the newly connected BT device as the default sound output by using following command: ```pactl set-default-sink NAME_OF_YOUR_BT_SPEAKER_FIND_IN_THE_PREV_STEP``` 
22. Check whether the output-audio is not muted, nor volume set to zero, by ```Mute:``` (should be ```no```) and  ```Volume:```, should be ```front-left: 65536 / 100% / 0.00 dB,   front-right: 65536 / 100% / 0.00 dB``` by using following commend: ```pactl list sinks | grep "Mute:"``` and ```pactl list sinks | grep "Volume:"```
23. Type ```ha audio reload``` and wait for ```Command completed successfully``` message on the terminal
24. At this point your BT should be connected to your HA
25. Type: ```exit```
    
### II. Installing required add-ons & integrations
1. Goto HA and install **Settings -> Add-in VLC Local**
2. Goto **VLC Local -> Configuration**
3. Set the **Telnet Password** and **Http Password** (you can use the default **mypasswrd** as well)
4. Change the **Audio-Output** to the corresponding **BT Name** (it's the same obtained at I.1 point)

6. Go back to VLC-Local **Info tab** and enable **Auto-Start** option
7. Get back to **Info** tab hit **Start**
8. Go to HA Settings -> **Devices & Services (Integrations)** and **Add New Integration**
9. Search for **VLC LAN** select it and pick-up **Local VLC Media player via Telnet**
10. Enter the password **Telnet Password** and click **Submit**
11. NOTE: in case when VM with HA restarts & or BT device shutdowns power on the dev (XMYX02YM should say "Connected" after a few seconds) and go to section **I.12** and **II.4** points, and start **VLC Local** back again

### III. Testing (Audio files)
1. Go to **Developers Tools** and **Services** and enter followings :
2. **Service** or **Actions** :  ```Media player: Play media```
3. **Target**: Search for ```VLC``` and select your one
4. **Content type**: ```music```
5. **Content ID**: ```/local/your.mp3``` (files your.mp3 should be located at the ```/local/www/``` folder of your HA installation)
6. Press **Call-Service** or **Perform the action**
